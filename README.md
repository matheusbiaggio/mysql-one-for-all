## ðŸ“’ Introduction

This was a project developed as a student at Trybe. The purpose of this project was to normalize a table from a fictitious music website. After normalizing the table, there is a folder called "Challenges" which contains 10 files, each named challengeX, where X represents the challenge number. Inside these files, there are queries, which are respectively:

-  1 - Creation of the database and insertion of values;
-  2 - Displays the quantity of songs, artists, and albums;
-  3 - Displays user, songs listened to, and total minutes;
-  4 - Displays the user's status if active or inactive;
-  5 - Displays the top 2 most played hits at the moment;
-  6 - Displays the company's revenue report;
-  7 - Displays a list of all albums produced by each artist;
-  8 - Displays a list of albums produced by the artist Elis Regina;
-  9 - Displays the number of songs currently present in the playback history.
